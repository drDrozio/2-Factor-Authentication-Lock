<h2>About this project</h2>
The conventional lock and key method cannot be used by a visually disabled person, while existing automated systems like fingerprint scanner, retina scan do not single handedly provide the desired level of security for the visually impaired. 
Hence, a locking system needs to be built, which is first of all easy and convenient for them to use and secondly, should be foolproof when it comes to safety since safety is one of the biggest concerns for the visually impaired.
This project aims to build a 2 factor authentication lock which would first use the face detection and then hand gestures to unlock the door. They can check who is at the door. This helps them to move freely in the house without any fear.
